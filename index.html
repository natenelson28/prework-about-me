      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I currently work as a middle school teacher (I know what you're thinking, but they're honestly not that bad). I got my bachelor's in theatre from Texas State in 2019, and started a theatre company based out of San Marcos that same year which is still going strong!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Being the child of a federal government agent, I had to move around a lot growing up. I was born in Laredo, Texas, moved to California when I was 2, Virginia when I was 11, then Alpine, TX when I was 14. Mostly, though, I just say San Marcos, as it's where I've chosen to live the longest and I like it the most.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love to read horror novels, watch movies, barbecue, play Dungeons and Dragons, board games, and video games.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Actor/director/writer</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>San Marcos, Texas.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Computers have always interested me and I like the puzzle aspect of piecing together a website or a code and trying different things until I figure out how to get it just right.</p>
